Fuckyeah is a drop-in solution for refactoring your code, specs, models and anything else you dare to refactor.
No dependencies, intuitive API, works fine with all Rubies, full test coverage and YARD documentation.
Everything you can dream of.

Getting started
---------------

Just install the gem and you’re ready to go:
```shell
gem install fuckyeah
```

Tests
-----

We’ve got [a full case test coverage suite](https://github.com/somu/fuckyeah/tree/master/test).
Well, almost.

So we **do need your help**.
Make a test which describes how does fuckyeah work with instances of a class ([String](https://github.com/somu/fuckyeah/tree/master/test/string.rb), for example) and pull request it.
I will be glad to pull it in the repo.

Don’t forget to pull request your real world experience with `#fuckyeah`.
